# insiible-project-a

This project is the first of our capstone projects and will target the implementation part of the training
showcasing the skills we've picked up through out the session;

## Scope

The project will be highlighting the following skills

* Version contol(git, github)
* IAC(terraform)
* Containerization(docker)
* Orchestration(kubernetes, helm)
* GitOps (argocd)
* Harshicorp vault(vault)


## High level overview of the project

This project is loaded indeed and we are going to try to approach it in a very simplified manner to make sure
the core reason why the project exist is understood!

The project will touch a lot of DevOps concepts and will give you a better understanding of the different DevOps
concept and implementation.

## Concepts

### Version Control System

A version control system (VCS) is a software tool that allows developers and teams to manage changes to their code
and documents over time. It keeps track of every modification made to files, enabling users to review, revert, or 
merge changes easily.

The main purpose of a VCS is to provide a collaborative and organized environment for multiple developers to work
on the same codebase simultaneously without conflicts.

### Infrastructure as Code

IAC stands for "Infrastructure as Code." It is a software engineering approach that involves managing and provisioning
infrastructure resources using code and automation rather than traditional manual processes.

In the context of cloud computing and DevOps practices, IAC allows developers and system administrators to define and deploy 
infrastructure resources, such as virtual machines, networks, storage, and services, through code scripts. These scripts can 
be written in configuration files or programming languages.

By treating infrastructure as code, teams can version control their infrastructure configurations and easily reproduce
environments consistently across different stages of development and deployment. This approach promotes consistency,
repeatability, and scalability while reducing the risk of configuration errors and manual setup discrepancies.
